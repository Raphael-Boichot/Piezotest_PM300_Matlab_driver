# Matlab codes to calibrate and make measurements with a [PM300 PiezoMeter system](https://www.piezotest.com/d33piezometer.php)

## Why ?

Because mesauring the d33 piezoelectric coefficient is harder than it looks, I have developped a series of codes to calibrate a PM300 PiezoMeter system and make accurate measurements with thin films. The device can of course be used directly from the front panel in "one shot" mode, but we found that measuring the d33 for a longer period of time, automatically with the serial port, give a better accuracy.

## What do the codes ?
